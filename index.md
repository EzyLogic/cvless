# Short Bio

I'm in my final year of the BSc Mathematics program at Vancouver Island University. I view mathematics as both a science and an art, valuing its abstract beauty as well as its real-world applications.

My primary research interests include discrete mathematics, abstract algebra, and applying computer science techniques to support mathematical research. I conducted undergraduate research in graph theory and pursuit-evasion game theory with the support of an NSERC USRA. I also enjoy sharing my passion for mathematics as a tutor at the VIU Math Learning Centre.

Beyond mathematics, I enjoy science fiction, R&B music, competitive video games, and I'm currently learning Spanish as a second language.
