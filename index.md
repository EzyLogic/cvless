# Brenden Gray

BSc Mathematics student at Vancouver Island University (expected June 2026). Passionate about graph theory, discrete mathematics, and their connections to computer science.

I am an undergraduate researcher with experience in graph theory and pursuit-evasion game theory, supported by an NSERC USRA. I enjoy helping others find the joy in math working as a tutor at the VIU Math Learning Centre.
